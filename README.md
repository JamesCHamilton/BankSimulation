# BankSimulation
Java MVN project 


🧱 1. Spring Security + JWT Authentication

Concepts learned: Authentication filters, password encoding, stateless sessions, @PreAuthorize.

Implementation:

Add a /auth/register and /auth/login endpoint.

Secure endpoints like /api/transfer with @PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')").

Store user credentials hashed (BCryptPasswordEncoder).

Issue a JWT token on login and use it for future requests.

👉 Learned skills: Filters, interceptors, UserDetailsService, SecurityContext, tokens.

⚙️ 2. Global Exception Handling + Custom Error Responses

Concepts learned: @ControllerAdvice, @ExceptionHandler, response unification.

Implementation:

Create a GlobalExceptionHandler.java to catch all exceptions and return consistent JSON like:

{ "error": "Unauthorized", "message": "You cannot access this account" }


Define custom exceptions: InsufficientFundsException, UnauthorizedAccessException.

👉 Learned skills: Centralized error handling, clean controller logic.

💬 3. Event-Driven Architecture with ApplicationEvents

Concepts learned: Spring event publishing and listeners.

Implementation:

When a transfer completes, publish an event:

applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(new TransferCompletedEvent(this, transfer));


Create listeners for TransferCompletedEvent to:

Log the event.

Send notification (simulated email/SMS).

Update an analytics table.

👉 Learned skills: Asynchronous event handling, decoupled communication.

🧩 4. Profiles and Environment Configuration

Concepts learned: @Profile, environment-based configs, application-{profile}.properties.

Implementation:

Have separate profiles:

application-dev.properties (local PostgreSQL)

application-prod.properties (AWS PostgreSQL)

Use @Profile("dev") to toggle logging or mock data.

👉 Learned skills: Managing environments for deployment.

📊 5. AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) for Logging & Auditing

Concepts learned: @Aspect, @Around, method interception.

Implementation:

Create an aspect that logs:

Method name

Arguments

Execution time

Apply it to your @Service layer.

👉 Learned skills: Cross-cutting concerns, proxy-based design.

🧠 6. Caching Layer with Spring Cache

Concepts learned: @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, caching strategies.

Implementation:

Cache frequent queries (e.g., getUserAccounts(userId)).

Use an in-memory cache like Caffeine or Redis (if you want to go advanced).

👉 Learned skills: Cache management, invalidation strategies.

🧵 7. Async Tasks and Thread Pooling

Concepts learned: @Async, TaskExecutor, concurrency control.

Implementation:

Process transfers asynchronously.

Configure ThreadPoolTaskExecutor and monitor pool size, queue depth.

👉 Learned skills: Thread management, task lifecycle, performance tuning.

🕵️‍♂️ 8. Spring Data Projections & Specifications

Concepts learned: Custom queries, filtering, pagination, projections.

Implementation:

Add an endpoint /api/transactions?from=2024-01-01&to=2025-01-01.

Use Spring Data JPA @Query or Specification for dynamic filtering.

Return lightweight DTO projections.

👉 Learned skills: Dynamic queries, query optimization.

🧮 9. Testing with Spring Boot Test and MockMvc

Concepts learned: Integration tests, mocking repositories, context loading.

Implementation:

Write unit tests for TransferService.

Integration tests for REST endpoints using @SpringBootTest and @AutoConfigureMockMvc.

👉 Learned skills: Testing Spring contexts and API validation.

☁️ 10. Deploying to AWS (Elastic Beanstalk + RDS)

Concepts learned: Environment variables, cloud databases, CI/CD.

Implementation:

Host your backend on AWS Elastic Beanstalk or EC2.

Connect to AWS RDS PostgreSQL.

Store secrets in environment variables.

👉 Learned skills: Cloud deployment, database configuration, CI/CD pipelines.
